# Mapping with R - ggmap

Code I created for a master's assignment to show how to use ggmap with R.


While working in R Studio with data that has a spatial reference, it can be extremely useful to plot it on a map. Combining data visualization techniques with a map can be an extremely useful tool, even for those whose main interest may not be spatial data analysis. Plotting your data on a map or on satellite imagery can be helpful for understanding how your data is distributed in the territory. Moreover, it can be very valuable to display the data using the vast possibilities offered by ggplot2, since it may allow you to see new details that you may not have been able to identify before.
 
In order to do it, I have used data from <a href="https://darmc.harvard.edu" target="_blank">'The Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations (DARMC)'</a>. It is a project hold by Harvard University and its aim is to provide "freely available on the internet the best available materials for a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) approach to mapping and spatial analysis of the Roman and medieval worlds". From the data available, I have been working with the Geodatabase of Ancient Ports and Harbors (version 1.1) (A. de Graauw, 2014).
